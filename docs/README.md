# pathglob

Glob library that mimics GitHub Actions behavior.

See [github_globs.md](./github_globs.md) for the behavior this library tries to replicate.

## Status

Good enough that I can try to integrate it into action-validator.

Will need a lot of rigor applied to it, but I want to see if I can complete the required implementation in action-validator to a satisfactory degree first.
